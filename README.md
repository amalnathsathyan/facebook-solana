# Steps Followed : 

* Created Next App using `npx create-next-app –e with-tailwindcss facebook-solana` 

* Created a sanity account. Created a folder called `studio` in the home directory and sanity was initialized into project using `sanity init` 

* *You can get a free boosted version of sanity using `sanity init --coupon cleverprogrammer`*
 
* ###### ERROR seen when tried these --> Export not working. `Parsing error: Cannot find module '@babel/preset-env'` But it's just an error in VSCode. If we open the `studio` folder in seperate VSCode window, it's working fine. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69467016/parsing-error-cannot-find-module-babel-preset-react]
